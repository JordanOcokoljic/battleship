# Battleship

This repo is my implementation of a state manager for the game
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) that was written as the response to a programming problem
set by a company that will remain unnamed to avoid ruining the validity of the exercise.

# Notes

The code was written in [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), but the solution should be able to be
opened in Visual Studio without any issues.
